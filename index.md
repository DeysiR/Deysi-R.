Hi there. 

My Name is Deysi and i'm in London for 5 years. 

After a few experiences working on wordpress websites i realize that i would need to know a litle bit more about this managment content sysyem. I was able to insert and change data but apart from that i couldn't really understand much.

I decide to take a part-time job so i could have some free time to teach myself code. 

So i apply for some courses online and also went to a shcool to learn css and html. From that moment i realize that i needed to became a web developer.

Is being a chalenge but also a joy because im doing what i like. 

I now applied to the founders and coders and firgers cross because this will change my life. 



to be continued..
