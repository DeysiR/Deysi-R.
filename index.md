Hello.

My name is Deysi and I've been in London for 5 years.

After some time working with wordpress websites, I realize that I would need to know a bit more about this content management system. I was able to insert and change data, but I could not understand much.

I decided to do a part-time job so I could have some time free to learn code.

So, i applied for some courses online and also went to a school to learn css and html. From that moment, I realized that I needed to become a web developer.

It's being a challenge, but also a joy because i'm doing what I like.

Now i applied to the founders and coders bootcamp and i'm looking foward to joing the team.

Fingers crossed because this can be change my life.



to be continued..
