## Welcome to my Page

Hi there. 

My Name is Deysi and i'm in London for 5 years. After a few experiences trying to do a wordpress website i realize that i would need to know a litle bit of code or at least understand what was behind the managment content system. 
So was when i start taking some courses, then i went to learn online and also went to a shcool to learn css and html.
From that moment i realize that i needed to know more and became a web developer.
Now i'm studyind the founders and coders courses online. Is being a chalenge but also a joy because you can learn so much from them.
