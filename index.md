Hello.

My name is Deysi and I've been in London for 5 years.

After some experiments working on wordpress websites, I realize that I would need to know a bit more about this content management system. I was able to insert and change data, but I could not understand much.

I decided to do a part-time job so I could have some free time to teach me code.

So I applied some courses online and also went to a school to learn css and html. From that moment, I realized that I needed to become a web developer.

is a challenge, but also a joy because I'm doing what I like.

Now I applied to the founders and coders three intensive months, really waiting to be selected.

Fingers crossed because this will change my life.



to be continued..
